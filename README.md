# Promise Rejection Dashboard Challenge

The Promise Rejection Dashboard Challenge is an interactive web-based project focusing on creating a Chrome Dashboard extension. This entails using api calls and async and await keywords to fetch
data from various api's. In addition, I had to use try and catch blocks to catch any errors that might arise during the api calls.
